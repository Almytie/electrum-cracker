bruteforcer for the 12 word brainwallet system of electum

You need a local instance of bitcoin-abe running, in order to access the balance of any address quickly.
Once you have set this up, just run "python bruteforcer.py" and cross your fingers.

You might need to install some missing python libries. Do this using apt-get or easy_install / pip.
